### OCD patient's dataset modelling:
- Description: The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" stands as a comprehensive repository, aggregating vital information from 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset is a treasure trove of detailed demographic and clinical profiles, encompassing a wide array of parameters essential for understanding OCD manifestations in patients.This dataset serves as a foundational resource for researchers, clinicians, and mental health professionals, empowering them to gain nuanced insights into OCD and its various presentations within a diverse patient cohort. With its rich and diverse information, the dataset holds immense potential for developing robust predictive models and insightful analyses to further the understanding and treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

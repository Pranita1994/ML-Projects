## Projects Overview

### Predictive Agriculture: Empowering Farmers with ML-driven Insights

- Description: The integration of Machine Learning (ML) into agricultural practices represents a groundbreaking opportunity to revolutionize traditional farming methods. By leveraging data-driven insights and predictive analytics, ML technologies offer the potential to optimize agricultural production, enhance crop yields, and mitigate risks arising from environmental uncertainties. This project explores the transformative impact of ML in agriculture, focusing on predictive modeling, precision farming techniques, and personalized interventions to usher in a more sustainable and efficient approach to food production.

### OCD patient's dataset modelling:
- Description: The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" stands as a comprehensive repository, aggregating vital information from 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset is a treasure trove of detailed demographic and clinical profiles, encompassing a wide array of parameters essential for understanding OCD manifestations in patients.This dataset serves as a foundational resource for researchers, clinicians, and mental health professionals, empowering them to gain nuanced insights into OCD and its various presentations within a diverse patient cohort. With its rich and diverse information, the dataset holds immense potential for developing robust predictive models and insightful analyses to further the understanding and treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

### Blueberry_yield_prediction_using_ml:
- Description: In agriculture, predictive analytics techniques can be used for crop yield prediction, risk mitigation, reducing the cost of fertilizers, etc. It is used in crop yield prediction based on weather conditions, soil quality, fruit set, fruit mass, etc. It is used to optimize the usage of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural practice. Predictive analytics is also used in applications like harvest scheduling, and predicting the risks of pesticides during crop plantations. The dataset used for predictive modeling was generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model, which is an open-source, spatially-explicit computer simulation program
